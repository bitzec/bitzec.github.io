										<h3 class="item-title">What is the difference between addresses that start with t and z?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>Addresses which start with "t" behave similarly to Bitcoin, exposing addresses and balances on the blockchain and we refer to these as "transparent addresses". Addresses which start with "z" include the privacy enhancements provided by <a href="#what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof">zero-knowledge proofs</a> and we refer to these as "shielded addresses". It is possible to send BZC between these two address types.</p>
<p>The <a href="../upgrade/sapling/index.html">Sapling network upgrade</a> introduces a new shielded address for improved efficiency and functionality. The legacy shielded addresses start with a "zc" and the new Sapling shielded addresses start with a "zs".
<p>See our blog posts <a href="../blog/anatomy-of-zcash/index.html">Anatomy of A BitzecTransaction</a> and <a href="../blog/sapling-transaction-anatomy/index.html">Sapling Transaction Anatomy</a> for more details.</p></div>

										<h3 class="item-title">Does Bitzechave multi-signature transactions?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>Yes, transparent addresses support multi-signature transactions but shielded addresses do not yet (see FAQ: <a href="#difference-between-t-and-z-addrs">difference between t and z addresses</a>). You can see the difference between single-signature and multi-signature transparent addresses with their starting characters: "t1" and "t3" respectively.</p>
<p>Note that it's possible to sandwich any transaction using transparent addresses — e.g. a multi-signature transaction — between private Bitzecspends. For example, do a private Bitzecspend to yourself, then do a globally transparent multi-signature transaction and then the new holder of the funds (possibly you or possibly someone else) does another private Bitzecspend to themselves.</p>
<p>Please consider the <a href="security/privacy-security-recommendations/index.html">privacy and security recommendations</a> before implementing such a strategy. Some privacy benefits may be preserved from that technique. We would caution against assuming this gives blanket privacy in general for any use, though, so this is an area for future study.</p></div>

                 <p>It is best practice to stop sending transactions near the network upgrade activation height; we recommend not sending transactions an hour or so beforehand. Transactions that are not mined before the activation height will need to be resent after the upgrade.</p>

										<h3 class="item-title">Since the value sent between shielded addresses is private, how can we determine the number BZC in circulation? </h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>Currently, we know that every miner validates every transaction, and each transaction comes with a <a href="#what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof ">zero-knowledge proof</a> that it doesn't violate conservation-of-money (i.e. a proof that the money coming out of the transaction is ≤ the money going into the transaction).</p>
<p>This reasoning depends on the soundness of the zero-knowledge proofs. If someone could get the miners to accept a transaction that created new money — if you could somehow forge a zero-knowledge proof or defeat the zero-knowledge-proof-verifier software in the miners — then you could counterfeit money.</p>

One fact to bear in mind is that the supply of Bitzecimmediately after launch was limited as described <a href="../blog/slow-start-and-mining-ecosystem.html">here</a>. For example, on October 29 (one day after the blockchain was created) there were 450 coins and on October 31 there were 1950. One thing that we <b>can</b> be sure of is that it had nothing to do with the Founders' Reward. The Founders' Reward coins are distributed incrementally over the first four years of the blockchain, and none of them were moved until December 21, as we wrote about <a href="../blog/founders-reward-transfers.html">here</a> and as you can see on the blockchain <a href="https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions/8361c0c88e8d088a20c0730d3872723be41fa925757ee92db4e2c639e7ddf9b0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>

										<h3 class="item-title">Simply put, what is a zero-knowledge proof? How does Bitzecintegrate it?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>Zero knowledge proofs are a scientific breakthrough in the field of cryptography: they allow you to prove knowledge of some facts about hidden information without revealing that information. The property of allowing both verifiability and privacy of data makes for a strong use case in all kinds of transactions, and Bitzecintegrates this concept into a blockchain for shielding the address, amount and memo field. A blockchain that protects transaction data and lacks zero-knowledge proofs also lacks the assurance that all the transactions are valid. This is because the nodes in the network can’t determine whether the sender really had that money or whether they previously sent it to someone else, or never had it in the first place. The transaction data becomes unverifiable by network nodes.</p>
<p>In Bitzec, we use a particular type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs (or “zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”). Within a shielded Bitzectransaction, there exists a string of data that the sender of a transaction provides –the “zero-knowledge proof”– along with the shielded transaction data which proves properties of the data cryptographically, including that the sender couldn’t have generated that string unless they had ownership over the spending key and unless the input and output values are equal. The proof also guarantees creation of a unique nullifier which is used to mark tokens as spent, when they are, in fact spent. This allows for verification that the transaction is valid, while preserving privacy of the transaction details.</p>

										<div class="item-desc"><p>Bitzecenhances privacy for users by encrypting sender, amount and recipient data within single-signature transactions published to its public blockchain ledger.</p>
<p>Bitzecdoes not: encrypt data for multisignature, protect against correlations made with public transactions (for example, when Bitzecis traded to/from another cryptocurrency) or obfuscate IP addresses. It is possible to use it in conjunction with an anonymizing network such as Tor, in order to obtain protection against network eavesdropping which is complementary to transaction privacy. Read more about the <a href="security/privacy-security-recommendations/index.html">privacy and security recommendations</a> when using Bitzec.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while Bitzecfacilitates anonymization for its users amongst a wide pool of individuals, we align more with the term “privacy” to describe what Bitzectechnology aims to provide. While related in scope, the terms have subtle differences. Anonymity relates to removing personal identifiers linked to potentially public data such as sending an anonymous tip to law enforcement or wearing a mask during a protest. Privacy considers the data itself in need of protection such as a discussion during a private meeting and more relevant, the encryption of information - whether for keeping personally or sharing with a select number of others. Anonymity methods can enhance privacy goals, such as defending against targeted attacks on private data, and vice versa if the protected data relates to personally identifiable information. The encryption of data in private Bitzectransactions aligns with the latter as it is foremost a tool for financial privacy with the added benefit of increased anonymity.</p>

										<h3 class="item-title">What are you changing from Bitcoin's Design? What parts of the Bitcoin network remain?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>We're following a general principle of "conservative innovation". Aside from the Zerocash privacy protocol (itself already a massive technological achievement), we wish to avoid making changes from Bitcoin's design without a strong rationale.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to make a number of relatively conservative changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We’ve adopted a “smooth” difficulty adjustment algorithm, based on DigiShield v3.</li>
                  <li>We’ve adopted a memory-hard proof of work, Equihash, which involves adding a memory-hard problem to be solved in valid blocks.</li>
                  <li>We’ve changed the block interval target from 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes, and modified other constants in order to preserve the monetary base of roughly 21 million coins and halving interval of 4 years.</li>
                  <li>We’ve increased the block size limit to 2MB.</li>
                  <li>We require coinbase transactions to contain an output to our Founders’ Reward P2SH address during the first 4 years before the first halving.</li>
                  <li>We require transactions spending coinbase outputs to contain no “transparent” outputs (vout should be empty).</li>
                  <li>We’ve removed activation rules for softforks in Bitcoin and made them enabled by default.</li>
                  <li>We've added a transaction expiry feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitzecembeds a confidential value transfer scheme alongside the traditional Bitcoin infrastructure; for most purposes, it simply adds additional behavior to the existing primitives.</p>

										<h3 class="item-title">How does Bitzeccompare to other cryptocurrencies with anonymizing properties?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>As mentioned in the FAQ <a href="#complete-anonymity">Does Bitzecoffer complete anonymity for transactions?</a>, the protection of data in shielded Bitzectransactions aligns more with the term "privacy" as it is foremost a tool for financial privacy with the added benefit of increased anonymity.</p>
<p>That said, in situations where anonymity can defend against targeted attacks on private data, you're better off being one of 2 million people who could have made a payment for a private medical procedure in San Francisco versus being one of 3 people, two of which live on the other side of the world. The size of this set matters, and the mixing strategies that other cryptocurrencies use for anonymity provide a rather small one in comparison to Bitzec. This is not to say these other methods are worthless, there are tradeoffs between the two, but Bitzec has a distinct advantage in terms of transaction privacy and as a result, anonymity.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid companies building profiles of people (especially those who pay for personal services such as psychiatry, drug rehabilitation, etc.) based on public blockchain data, using Bitzeccan help. Shielded addresses are indistinguishable from all other shielded addresses in the system.</p>

										<h3 class="item-title">What are SNARK public parameters? How did the BitzecCeremony generate the SNARK parameters securely?</h3>
										<div class="item-desc"><p>A set of public parameters are required for generating the proofs required to validate private transactions. The process of generating these public parameters (commonly referred to as “paramgen”) also produces a by-product (which we have nicknamed the “toxic waste”) that could be used to subvert the block chain by creating fake coins that are indistinguishable from real ones (the relationship between the public parameters and this toxic waste is similar to that between a public key and a private key). It is therefore important that this toxic waste be securely destroyed. </p>
<p>We designed a process whereby the job of generating the public parameters was split between a number of people, each of whom generated a piece of the parameters during what we refer to as the BitzecCeremony. These pieces were then brought together and combined to create the public parameters. As long as one of the people involved in generating the parameters destroyed their portion of the “toxic waste”, there is no way to subvert the parameters.</p>

The zk-SNARKs technology used for shielding this data introduced limitations on usability which those familiar with other cryptocurrencies may notice.</p>
<p>The <a href="../upgrade/sapling/index.html">Sapling network upgrade</a> introduces a new shielded address type with significant improvements in most of these legacy usability limitations. Multi-signature support is still in the works.</p>
<p>Note that coinbase transactions which pay out block rewards and transaction fees to miners require transparent addresses for accounting purposes. These coinbase transactions to miners do, however, include an additional requirement that their subsequent spend goes to a shielded address.</p>

We expect the number to increase significantly with <a href="../upgrade/sapling/index.html">Sapling</a> activated and the subsequent adoption of shielded addresses by ecosystem services.</p>

<p>Note that a big part of the shielded addresses used are due to the consensus rule requirement of coinbases to be shielded when first spent. This was in order to provide a guaranteed privacy-set.

										<div class="item-desc"><p>Large quantum computers, if and when built, would be capable of breaking an encryption scheme used by Bitzec. As a result, an attacker with access to such a computer could check if a transaction's recipient matches some given address. In case it does, the attacker could now discover the amount and encrypted memo attached to the transaction (but not the sender). It could also compute the note's nullifier, which means it could track when the recipient subsequently spent this note. Note that shielded addresses don't appear on the blockchain, and those shared privately and unknown to an adversary would not be vulnerable. (Again, no information on the sender address of a transaction can be extracted, even if the address were known to the attacker.)</p>
<p>In addition, large quantum computers would be able to fool zk-SNARK verification, and thus counterfeit BZC.</p>
<p>Both of these attacks would require quantum computers with thousands of qubits (capable of solving the discrete-logarithm problem), which are at least decades away from today's state of the art by most experts' estimates.</p>
<p>Scientists at Binary Digit Electronic Currency, and academia, are actively researching postquantum-secure alternatives to the affected cryptographic components (see issue <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/805" target="_blank">#805</a>). We plan to monitor developments in postquantum-secure components, and if/when they are mature and practical, update the Bitzecprotocol to use them.</p></div>
